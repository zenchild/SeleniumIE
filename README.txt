This program attempts to output Selenium code within RSpec tests that is
generated by attaching to a Win32ole Internet Explorer application and
listening for events. I hope that this will provide similar functionality
for IE that the wonderful SeleniumIDE for Firefox already achieves.

Once you close out the browser you should be able to run the output file
by running*:
> spec selenium_out.txt


* Make sure selenium-rc is running.
