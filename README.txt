                       Selenium Recorder for IE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program attempts to output Selenium code within RSpec tests that is
generated by attaching to a Win32ole Internet Explorer application and
listening for events. I hope that this will provide similar functionality
for IE that the wonderful SeleniumIDE for Firefox already achieves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you close out the browser you should be able to run the output file
by running*:
> spec selenium_out.txt


* Make sure selenium-rc is running.

I would like to thank Michael S. Kelly, John Hann, and Scott Hanselman for
their work on WatirMaker.rb, which inspired this code.  Early versions of
this script contained quite a bit of the code used in WatirMaker.rb.
